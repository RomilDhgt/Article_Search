This code is a Streamlit web application for a news search tool. It allows users to input URLs of news articles, processes the URLs to extract information, builds an embedding vector using the OpenAI language model, and stores the resulting vector in a FAISS index. Users can then enter a question, and the application retrieves relevant information using the FAISS index and presents the answer along with potential sources related to the question. The user interface is created using Streamlit, and the language model and vector store functionalities are implemented using the Langchain library.
